### Here is the link to the live website: [Contact Keeper](https://contact-keeper-mern1234.herokuapp.com/login)

If you do not want to register here is the account information for a dummy account:

- Username: JDoe@gmail.com
- Password: 123456

This was built from a [Brad Traversy tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/user/brad-traversy/).

After you register for the application, you can keep your contacts together in one spot. Quickly filter to the contact you need. Identify if it is a professional or a personal acquaintance. Built as a mern app.

Another application that I designed started to have a lot of code that could have been written better. So I looked for a better way and found a tutorial to help me code cleaner.
